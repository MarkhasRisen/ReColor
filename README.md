# ReColor - Adaptive Daltonization Pipeline

This repository contains an end-to-end adaptive color correction system tailored for color-vision deficiencies. The platform combines perceptual modeling, clustering, and neural color transforms to deliver real-time corrections across web/mobile clients.

## Subsystems

- **backend/** â€“ Flask API serving TensorFlow Lite models, Daltonization utilities, Ishihara test endpoints, and calibration workflows.
- **training/** â€“ Notebooks and scripts for dataset preparation, K-Means centroid caching, daltonization calibration, and CNN export to TFLite.
- **mobile/** â€“ React Native/Expo client with 16 screens for Ishihara testing, CVD surveys, camera features, and Firebase-backed authentication.
- **docs/** â€“ Architecture notes, research references, and design records.

## High-Level Flow

1. Users complete an Ishihara-based calibration module through the mobile client (Quick or Comprehensive test).
2. Calibration responses are posted to the backend, generating individualized deficiency profiles stored in Firebase.
3. The backend selects or composes a TensorFlow Lite color transform pipeline that applies:
   - Pixel grouping via K-Means clustering to limit per-frame compute cost.
   - Daltonization adjustments along confusion lines derived from the user profile.
   - CNN-driven adaptive corrections to restore perceptual contrast while preserving luminance cues.
4. The corrected imagery is delivered back to the client or executed locally when on-device models are available.

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- Backend API with Ishihara test endpoints (14 & 38 plates)
